// Final.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//Programmer: Brenna Meyer
// Date:05/06/2025
//Requirements: Write a modular program that asks the user for a file name. Assume the file contains a series of numbers, each written on a separate line. The program should read the contents of the file into an array then display the following data:
//• The lowest number in the array
//• The highest number in the array
//• The total of the numbers in the array
//• The average of the numbers in the array
//To test the program, you can download the file numbers.txt or ListOfNumbers.txt
//You may also want to create your own file with something funky in it to see how
//well your code handles it.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
}

// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu

// Tips for Getting Started: 
//   1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files
//   2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control
//   3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages
//   4. Use the Error List window to view errors
//   5. Go to Project > Add New Item to create new code files, or Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project
//   6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > Project and select the .sln file
